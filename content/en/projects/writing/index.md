The GRV Greyhound Racing Model showcases my innovation in predictive machine learning. Leveraging custom neural network architectures, this project demonstrated my ability to implement complex ML models that tackled non-uniform time series data. It stands as a testament to my ML proficiency and hands-on experience with end-to-end development, from data aggregation to model inference.

- Constructed a predictive ML model for greyhound race outcomes.
- Integrated automated API data-feeds for model accuracy.
- Developed a custom GRU to handle unique time series challenges.
- Enabled remote monitoring with a live performance dashboard.
