In today's rapidly evolving job market, especially in fields like AI and Machine Learning, understanding trends and opportunities can be challenging. That's why I'm excited to introduce VectoredIn, a project I recently developed as part of the Weaviate Machine Learning Engineer challenge.

## What is VectoredIn?

VectoredIn is a web application that brings a new perspective to job market analysis. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, it allows users to visualize and explore job listings in a unique, three-dimensional space.

## Key Features

1. **3D Semantic Visualization**: The heart of VectoredIn is its interactive 3D plot. Users can define custom semantic axes, allowing for intuitive exploration of job listings based on skills, requirements, or any other relevant factors.

2. **RAG-Enhanced Search**: Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), VectoredIn provides context-rich search results, offering deeper insights into job listings.

3. **Intelligent Summaries**: The application generates concise summaries of job clusters, highlighting key trends and differences across listings.

4. **Precision Alignment Analysis**: Users can select specific points in the 3D space to get detailed breakdowns of how individual job listings align with the chosen semantic axes.

## The Technology Behind It

VectoredIn is built on a stack of cutting-edge technologies. At its core, it uses Weaviate for vector storage and retrieval, complemented by custom implementations of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for efficient similarity search. The frontend leverages Plotly for dynamic, interactive visualizations, while the backend is powered by Django and Python.

## Why It Matters

In an era where job roles and required skills are constantly evolving, tools like VectoredIn can provide valuable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and industry analysts alike. By visualizing the job market in this novel way, we can uncover patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.
