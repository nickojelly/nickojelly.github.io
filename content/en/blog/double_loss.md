In my recent work on a greyhound racing prediction model, I've discovered an effective technique to not only increase the model's performance but also stabilize it and reduce overfitting. This technique involves the use of multiple loss functions.

Traditionally, a single loss function is used to train a model. The model's parameters are adjusted to minimize this loss, which is a measure of the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data. However, in complex tasks like greyhound racing prediction, a single loss function may not capture all the nuances of the problem.

In my model, I used three different loss functions, each focusing on a different aspect of the data:

The first loss function focuses on the margin of victory. This is a common target in racing prediction models, as it directly relates to the outcome of the race.

The second loss function targets the one-hot encoded win. This categorical target helps the model to directly predict the winner of the race.

The third loss function targets the starting prices as probabilities. This allows the model to understand the betting market's opinion about the race, which can be a valuable source of information.

By training the model to minimize all three loss functions simultaneously, it learns to make predictions that are accurate in multiple respects. This not only improved the model's performance on the main metric (loss to margin) but also made the model more stable and less prone to overfitting.

This approach of using multiple loss functions can be applied to other complex prediction tasks as well. It's a powerful way to make your model learn from different perspectives and thus make more accurate and robust predictions.
