      <description>The GRV Greyhound Racing Model represents a personal project in deep machine learning, aimed at predicting the outcomes of races across Australia and New Zealand. Tailoring a custom Gated Recurrent Unit model to navigate the complexities of non-uniform time series data in greyhound racing, the project serves as a prime example of innovative problem-solving and application of advanced machine learning techniques.&#xA;Developed a deep learning model for predicting race outcomes. Automated real-time data updates via integrated API feeds.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Targets for Predictive Models</title>

      <description>I was recently awarded a prize in a Datathon hosted by Betfair based around predicting the outcome of greyhound races using Machine Learning. I learnt a great deal over this experience and one piece of this was around optimizing the target&amp;rsquo;s used in training a ML model. The goal of the competition was simple, to have the lowest log loss between your predictions and the outcome of the races, a standard classification task.</description>

      <title>Methods for visualizing internal hidden states in Gated Recurrant networks</title>

      <description>When faced with a predictive problem involving time-series data, recurrent neural networks are a natural choice. For the recent project I have been working on which is predicting greyhound races using previous form data, the switch from a simple classic Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) to a Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) has drastically increased the performance achieved by the model. However one of the main drawbacks I&amp;rsquo;ve found is that GRUs are orders of magnitude more complicated, and as such can but harder to diagnose issues and to visualize.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model Performance and Stability with Multiple Loss Functions</title>

      <description>In my recent work on a greyhound racing prediction model, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered an effective technique to not only increase the model&amp;rsquo;s performance but also stabilize it and reduce overfitting. This technique involves the use of multiple loss functions.&#xA;Traditionally, a single loss function is used to train a model. The model&amp;rsquo;s parameters are adjusted to minimize this loss, which is a measure of the difference between the model&amp;rsquo;s predictions and the actual data.</description>
